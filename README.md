# Reg-Expression-for-NLP

"Excited to share my latest work in Natural Language Processing (NLP)! 

In this notebook, I explored various techniques to extract valuable information from unstructured text data. I successfully retrieved order numbers, combined pattern matching for enhanced results, extracted email IDs and phone numbers, and even obtained insightful details like age, name, date of birth, and place of birth from the text.

NLP opens up a world of possibilities for understanding and analyzing human language, and I'm thrilled to have made progress in this field. It's fascinating how we can leverage NLP to uncover hidden patterns and extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of text data.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to dive into NLP and apply it to real-world scenarios. This project has been a great learning experience, and I'm excited to share my findings with the LinkedIn community.

Check out my notebook on GitHub to explore the code and methodology behind my NLP work. Let's continue pushing the boundaries of AI and NLP together!
